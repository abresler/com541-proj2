##Project Description

**Due March 31**

In stark contrast to the first project, which emphasizes visual display of information, Project 2 looks at the structural/semantic design of information that can be easily retrieved and shared across different devices and platforms. Working from a data set similar to that of your first project, you will create a structural information design either as a series of XML or JSON files, or as a relational database (e.g., MySQL).

A central concern of this project will be granularity: you will need a structural representation of the list of all of the records that make up your dataset (at least one XML or JSON file) and a structural representation of each record itself (one XML/JSON file per record, most likely).

You will also need to come up with some sort of metadata scheme to categorize and/or tag the records that make up your set. This may come in the form of XML attributes, special XML tags, or specific JSON properties and language features (especially arrays).

###Deliverables & Milestones
  * A proposal memo (about a paragraph or two) emailed to the instructor by 9am on Monday, March 3
  * A shared Dropbox link to all deliverables
  * An HTML or PDF document that shows your in-progress work and briefly discusses your design process and thinking over the course of the project
  * A series of XML or JSON files (if you wish to do a relational database, we will need to discuss how to submit that work): one file providing a listing of all records that is then somehow keyed (e.g., through a unique identifier) to the individual records (one record per file, unless another schema presents itself that makes better sense for your particular dataset)
  * A self-critique memo that evaluates your project and your progress in the class to this point (2-3 paragraphs; submit via email with Dropbox share link)
  * A brief (5-8 minutes) presentation of your work on March 24

###Requirements

####Your dataset must:
  * Be openly/freely available from some governmental, educational, or private source; it can also be a dataset of your own creation
  * Be chosen/created with regard to the next project, which involves an interactive information display (hint: think about the importance of density from Project 1)

####Your structural XML or JSON designs must:
  * Be versioned across the life of your project to showcase the progress of your thinking and design work (HTML or PDF deliverable; extra credit for using Git/GitHub)
  * Use UTF-8 encoded text files as their foundations (*not* word-processor documents)
  * Be both valid (technically correct for parsing) and structurally semantic (using XML tags or JSON property names that describe the structure and content of your data)
  * Be named as well as structured for both machine- and human-friendly readability
