        "description": "Depository Access to Reports, Technical and Scientific (DARTS) provides access to government-produced technical information. DARTS features full-text files that have been posted by the National Technical Information Service (NTIS) as a result of a purchase request.  This database covers the period 1964-present.  Because the DARTS database only provides access to digitized materials, the collection is a tiny fraction of the full NTIS collection.  DARTS is provided by the Department of Commerce only to participating Depository libraries and requires a Reference Librarian for a moderated login.",
