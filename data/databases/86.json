News, photographs, renderings, and firm data are collected by over 700 editors for more than 50,000 cities worldwide. These experienced authors and correspondents report 24 hours a day on new projects and developments in architecture, engineering, construction, and real estate with a high regard for accurate and reliable information. Emporis's goal is to list every structure in the world which is of public or commercial interest; from a hut to a skyscraper. This resource will be particularly useful to Architecture and Civil Engineering researchers.",
